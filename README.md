CFA10036-GTK-Dependencies
=========================

This repository contains the files necessary to build gtk+ apps for the CFA10036. 

All known gtk+ dependencies have been aggregated together into this repo as a quick and easy way to start working on the CFA10036. An example makefile is included in the folder because I originally found the task of figuring out how to cross compile it all quite confusing when working on windows.

If there are any files that this repo is lacking in, I would appreciate you reporting it as a bug, and possibly submiting a pull request with the needed file. This goes true for unnecessary files as well.

Friendly and constructive criticism is Welcomed and appreciated.
